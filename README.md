This is the apps demo code to help build an environment for user testing and a design template built in HTML/CSS.

Getting Started
===========================

* Grab the bootstrap code from https://github.com/mozilla/bootstrap
 * Use the following commands from the Terminal to do this:
 * `git clone git@github.com:mozilla/bootstrap.git`
 * `cd bootstrap`
 * `git checkout apps-demo`

All the code in the demo references the bootstrap code like so `../bootsrap/` for JS and CSS files.
